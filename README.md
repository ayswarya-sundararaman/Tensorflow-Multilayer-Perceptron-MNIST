# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Model

This project implements a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** model using Keras for classification tasks. The MLP is a fully connected feedforward neural network, designed to learn complex patterns in data.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled instances for classification (specific dataset details should be mentioned).
- **Features**: Numerical and categorical input features.
- **Target**: Multi-class or binary classification depending on the dataset.

## Model Architecture
1. **Input Layer**: Accepts input data with the number of features matching the dataset.
2. **Hidden Layers**:
   - Two or more fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
   - Applied **Dropout** for regularization to prevent overfitting.
3. **Output Layer**:
   - Softmax activation function for multi-class classification or sigmoid for binary classification.

## Key Techniques
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Normalized data to ensure consistent feature scaling.
  - Split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: **Adam** optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
  - Loss Function: **Categorical Crossentropy** (for multi-class classification) or **Binary Crossentropy** (for binary classification).

- **Evaluation**:
  - Tracked model accuracy and loss over epochs.
  - Visualized performance using plots of training and validation loss/accuracy.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high classification accuracy after training over multiple epochs.
- **Model Convergence**: Training and validation losses decreased steadily, indicating proper learning.

## Conclusion
The MLP model is effective for classification tasks, demonstrating robust performance with appropriate regularization techniques like dropout to avoid overfitting.
